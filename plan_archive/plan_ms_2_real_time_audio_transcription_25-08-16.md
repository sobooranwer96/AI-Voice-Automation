Overall Project Plan
Overall Goal
The goal of this project is to build a scalable, real-time audio streaming and processing application using a FastAPI WebSocket server. This application will serve as a core component for a professional product, allowing for continuous, low-latency audio communication.

Milestone 2: Real-time Audio Transcription
Goal
The goal of this milestone is to integrate Google Cloud Speech-to-Text into our FastAPI application. We will modify our WebSocket endpoint to receive a real-time stream of audio data, send it to the Google Cloud API, and receive the transcribed text in response. This is a crucial step towards a fully functional voice assistant.

New Technologies
Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API: The cloud-based service for converting speech to text.

google-cloud-speech library: The official Python client library for interacting with the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.

Asynchronous Generators (async def with yield): A powerful Python feature that is ideal for streaming data, which we'll use to efficiently send audio chunks to the Google API.

Subtasks
Google Cloud Project Setup: Create a Google Cloud Platform account, set up a new project, and enable the Speech-to-Text API.

Authentication: Generate a service account key and configure your local environment to authenticate your Python code with Google Cloud.

Install the Python Client Library: Install the google-cloud-speech package.

Modify the WebSocket Endpoint: Change the FastAPI code to receive binary audio data from the client, rather than text.

Implement the Streaming Logic: Write the code that takes the incoming audio data, streams it to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, and yields the transcription results.

Test the Transcription: Have the client send audio from a microphone and print the transcription results in your terminal.
