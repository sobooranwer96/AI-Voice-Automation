# Overall Project Plan

## Overall Goal
The goal of this project is to build a scalable, real-time audio streaming and processing application using a FastAPI WebSocket server. This application will serve as a core component for a professional product, allowing for continuous, low-latency audio communication.

---

## Milestone 1: Establish a Basic FastAPI WebSocket Server

### Goal
The goal of this milestone is to set up a minimal but functional FastAPI application with a WebSocket endpoint. This will serve as the foundation for our real-time audio pipeline, ensuring that a client can connect and exchange messages with the server.

### New Technologies
* **FastAPI**: A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.
* **Uvicorn**: A lightning-fast ASGI server, which is required to run FastAPI.

### Subtasks
1.  **Install Project Dependencies**: Install FastAPI and Uvicorn using pip.
2.  **Create a WebSocket Endpoint**: Write the Python code to create a basic FastAPI application and a `/ws` WebSocket endpoint.
3.  **Implement Basic Communication**: Add logic to the WebSocket endpoint to accept a connection, receive a text message, and send a text message back.
4.  **Run the Server**: Start the FastAPI application locally using Uvicorn.
5.  **Test the Connection**: Use a WebSocket client (like the one suggested previously) to verify that the connection is successful and that messages are being sent and received correctly.
