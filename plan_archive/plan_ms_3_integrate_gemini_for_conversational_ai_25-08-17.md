Overall Project Plan
Overall Goal
The goal of this project is to build a scalable, real-time audio streaming and processing application using a FastAPI WebSocket server. This application will serve as a core component for a professional product, allowing for continuous, low-latency audio communication and intelligent conversational responses.

Milestone 3: Integrate Gemini LLM for Conversational AI
Goal
The goal of this milestone is to integrate the Gemini Large Language Model (LLM) into our FastAPI application. We will take the transcribed text from Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, send it to Gemini to generate a natural language response, and then prepare that response for the next stage (Text-to-Speech). This will enable our voice assistant to understand user queries and generate intelligent, conversational replies.

New Technologies
Gemini API: Google's powerful Large Language Model for understanding and generating human-like text.
google-generativeai library: The official Python client library for interacting with the Gemini API.
Subtasks
Gemini API Key Setup: Obtain a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio and set it as a permanent environment variable (GEMINI_API_KEY).
Install the Gemini Python Client Library: Install the google-generativeai package.
Modify the STT Worker to Call Gemini: Update the stt_worker function in main.py to:
Initialize the Gemini client.
Send the final transcribed text to Gemini.
Receive Gemini's text response.
Forward Gemini's response (or an indication of it) back to the main WebSocket handler via the responses_q.
Update WebSocket Handler for Gemini Responses: Modify the websocket_endpoint to handle the new type of message from the STT worker (Gemini's response) and log it.
Test LLM Integration: Speak into the microphone, observe the transcription in the browser, and then verify that Gemini's response is logged in your terminal.
